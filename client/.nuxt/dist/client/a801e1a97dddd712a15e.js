Those who have overcome tremendous obstacles deserve a moment in the spotlight, and we all have a story that deserves to be told, whether you are the fastest or the slowest. Friends and family who want to see results shouldn't have to dig through Google to find a results link or wait for days, to see their loved ones' race times. Missing or inaccurate results should not exist, and the members of the running community should not have to pay to watch the sport they love. These are our founding principles and are the driving forces behind every feature that we add and decision that we make. \n    ")]),a("p"),a("h5",[t._v("We believe that people, and the connections we make with them, are more important than any race, or time, or championship.")]),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("\n      Every athlete has fought to overcome something, and every athlete has helped someone close to them to do the same.

We aim to showcase the athletes that deserve to be recognized for outstanding achievements, whether that’s a huge improvement from season to season or an act of exemplary sportsmanship.
