# RaceBase
## Community sourced running results

RaceBase is an online resource for runners. We were sick of crummy websites owning our hard earned results, with no ability to customize our profiles, edit inaccurate results, or add ones that were missing. So we made our own database and opened it up to the community. 

We also offer customizable Training Logs that allow you to keep track of things like your sleep, how you felt on a run, weight routines, and more. 

With your Feed, you can now follow athletes who are important to you and see their most recent results and stories all in one place. You can also write your own stories and tie them to your results.

We are always updating and improving upon RaceBase, and you can see our changes here.

### This repository contains the Frontend client for RaceBase. It is a hybrid SSR / SPA created with the Nuxt library (and more). For our API, look [here](https://github.com/racebase-io/racebase-api)
