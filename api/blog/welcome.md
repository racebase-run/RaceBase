We've decided to move away from running news stories, for a couple reasons: firstly, it takes a lot of time and resources. There are hundreds of meets around the world every week in the middle of a season, and to stay up to date on all of them and pick out the most important ones is a massive time suck. Every article also requires images, research on relevant athletes, and more, which takes even more resources that we don't have and that could be better spent delivering a better product to our users. The second reason is that there are plenty of outlets that already exist who do a good job at covering meets. The fact that some charge for coverage (ahem, Flotrack) is still very frustrating to us, and eventually we'd love to offer free meet live streaming... but at this point in time, its infeasible. 

So instead of news, we're starting a development blog that will serve a few purposes. For those of you out there who are developers too, it might be interesting or useful for you to see the inner workings of RaceBase, why we made some of our decisions regarding the technologies we use, and the practical implementation of some of our features. The dev blog will also offer exclusive previews into [what's coming](https://racebase.io/roadmap), and for our own sanity, it's for sharing the massive undertakings we've gone through to deliver seemingly simple things. 

Our goal is to post weekly or biweekly, so stay tuned for more. API documentation is coming soon (on or before March 5)!
