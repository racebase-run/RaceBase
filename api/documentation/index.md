## Welcome to the RaceBase API

All API access is through HTTPS, and is accessed with `https://api.racebase.io`.

Every API call will take the format

`https://api.racebase.io/ROUTE/QUERY`

where `ROUTE` is the category you'd like to query and `QUERY` is the more specific query of data you'd like. For example, 

`https://api.racebase.io/result/count` 

will return the current total number of results in our database.

All available Routes are listed on the sidebar, with their documentation available by clicking through.
