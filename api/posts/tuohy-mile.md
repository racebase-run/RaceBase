With an undefeated Cross Country season and a national High School record in the 5k (15:37), [Katelyn Tuohy](https://racebase.io/athlete/katelyntuohy) has already established herself as one of the greatest High School distance runners of all time. Thus, her impressive 4:39 performance at Tuesday's [Millrose Games Trials](https://racebase.io/races/5c37828be6082e1bae2605f0/womens/2) at the Armory in New York should come as no suprise. 

Despite the performance, Tuohy may not compete at the Millrose Games in early February, and instead choose to focus on the Dr. Sanders Invitational at the end of January. Her goal for Tuesday's race, she says, was to focus on pacing rather than going all out - and with a 4:28 mile PR, it was apparent in watching her race that the 4:39 was not a huge struggle.

Other highlights of Tuesday's trials included Christian Brothers Academy's [Tim McInerney](https://racebase.io/athlete/timmcinerney) taking the boys mile title in 4:16.01 with Ridgewood High's [Will Baginski](https://racebase.io/athlete/willbaginski) not far behind in 4:16.87.
