The past 6 months, we've been working on completely revamping the architecture of our site. While many of the changes we've made are not directly visible to you, this revamp means that we can deliver new features and results more quickly while keeping the site running smoothly. Some things you may notice are the new Settings and Content pages when you log in, and faster loading times in general. 

Our first priority moving forward will be to upload results. Despite the fact that RaceBase is designed to rely on the community for the majority of its results, our community does not have the volume needed to completely populate the database; as such, our administrators will be taking results from across the web and uploading them here. If you find gaps in your own running portolio, please don't hesitate to fill them by adding your own results -- that's the beauty of RaceBase. 

While prioritizing result aggregation, we will also be working on adding new features and perfecting user experience. RaceBase is still very much in beta, and that is reflected in its fit and finish, so we'll be rolling out frequent updates to improve upon this. 

Additional upgrades we hope to bring to you soon include revamped Profile pages with support for profile pictures and interesting metrics like Miles per Week and Current Trainer, a brand new Feed page with following functionality to make it easier for you to see the results and races you care about most, and a redesigned News page.

Further down the road, we hope to offer Coaching tools, live coverage of races with live results and video streams, and more upgrades to make RaceBase the best it can be.
