If you're reading this, you're likely one of the first people to use RaceBase; please know that you are appreciated and don't hesitate to let us know if there's anything we can do to improve your experience! RaceBase is still in its infancy, and any input from you as a community member will help tremendously in our quest to provide the best user experience we can. If there's something you hate, whether it's as small as the placement of a button or as big as the color scheme of the whole website, please let us know! Email us 24/7 at <racebase@breeze.software> with any questions, comments, or random thoughts and we will get back to you promptly. 

If you're not sure where to get started, a good place to begin is by creating an account and claiming your Athlete ID. Athlete ID's are automatically assigned to results that have been uploaded by our Administrators (typically the athlete's first and last name as one word), but to be sure you can use the search bar on the left to find one of your results. Once you've found the Athlete page with your results on it, if you're logged in you can click the prompt at the top of the page to claim your ID.

Our goal is to post news weekly, at the very least. Typically news stories will be about something exciting that occured in the world of running; whether that's something like Desiree Linden becoming the first American woman in 33 years to win the Boston Marathon, a high school runner shaving 3 minutes off of their 5k time to qualify for the state meet, or a shocking disqualification at a Diamond League meet, our goal is to offer a unique take on the state of our sport. Sometimes that will be through opinion pieces and other times it may be with an unbiased, factual account, but be forewarned - this is not your typical running blog. Stay hungry, stay tuned, and we hope you enjoy RaceBase!
