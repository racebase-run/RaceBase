A month ago, we promised that we would begin bringing you new features on a more consistent basis. While is has been longer than we had hoped since our last update, our backend restructuring did pay off in helping us upgrade our user interface in a single month rather than six. For those that have been here since the beginning, thank you for your patience. 

A few things you'll notice as you use RaceBase are a completely redesigned homepage, a new athlete profile page that allows registered users to customize their own profiles by adding things like a profile picture, featured image, brand or team logo, current racing and training shoes, current training location, and weekly mileage. You'll also notice that we added a "Tweet" button near the top of athlete profiles to make it easier to share with others, and soon we'll be adding the option to link to your Strava on your profile as well. 

Other updates include a new sidebar that gives you easy access to our latest news, and a few new links at the bottom of that sidebar as well. We hope you enjoy the updates, and as always, if you have comments or suggestions please email us at <racebase@breeze.software>. Thank you!
