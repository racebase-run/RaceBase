It is a Christmas tradition shared by runners all over the country, and quite possibly the world; a tradition that makes one question every year why it is tradition at all. It is the ugly cousin of the beer mile, and likely accounts for 90% of annual Egg Nog sales. We are, of course, talking about the Egg Nog Mile. 

Just outside of Sacramento, California, sits American River College, home of the Beavers. The ARC men’s cross country team has claimed 39 Conference titles and 5 State titles since 1964 - winning is obviously an integral part of this teams’ pedigree, but so is fun. Hence, the annual unofficial "Nog Jog" Egg Nog Mile. 

This year’s festivities featured a special guest: professional Nike athlete [Craig Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Engels), who arrived in a full length leopard print robe and ran in a Christmas tree suit. The event kicked off at 7pm Sunday evening, with the actual race beginning at about 7:30. Upwards of 30 people attended, some of whom (including myself) decided to forgo treating their stomachs like a garbage disposal and downing nearly half a gallon of the worst drink known to man. 

The rules of the Nog Jog are simple - before each lap, competitors must drink 12 fluid ounces of full-fat egg nog before beginning the next lap. As this was a full mile, the athletes lined up 11 meters behind the 400 meter start line and began drinking. 

Early leader was [Conor Wells](/athlete/conorwells), an ARC alumni who now runs for Chico State. Wells was followed by Engels, [Vincent Chevreuil](/athlete/vincentchevreuil), [Brad Needles](/athlete/bradleyneedles), and several others. After the first lap, however, the nog had taken its toll on Wells - he decided to drop out and spare everyone from seeing the contents of his stomach. Chevreuil was the clear winner of the second chug, downing his glass in less than 3 seconds. Needles, sporting a onesie, was not far behind, while Engels seemed to struggle to put his away. It was no matter, as by the end of the second lap Engels had caught both Needles and Chevreuil. This trend continued for the penultimate lap, but Chevreuil and Needles managed to maintain their lead for slightly longer. Finally, the bell lap began and Chevreuil was off to a massive lead - already 50 meters ahead by the time Needles managed to finish his nog, and nearly 100 meters separated him and Engels by the time Engels began. All three runners summoned godly efforts to finish off the race, but fatigue started to set in as Needles and Engels reeled in Chevreuil. Engels’ mid-distance advantage started to show itself by the time they hit 200 meters to go, but his 56 second 4th lap wasn’t enough to catch either runner. Chevreuil finished with a time of 5:13, with Needles and Engels both coming in at 5:15 as the rest of the field began to trickle in during the minutes to come. 

One may wonder how Engels ended up at the small event; the American River College team took a visit to Nike’s World Headquarters earlier this year, during which they ran around the famed Nike HQ track. Engels, who runs for the Nike Oregon Project and trains in Beaverton where Nike is located, happened to be there doing an interview for The Toad. They talked and introduced themselves, and some months later one of them messaged Engels and invited him to the annual Nog Jog… the rest is history.
