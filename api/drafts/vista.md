Every year at the tail end of July, a couple dozen members Vista del Lago cross country team travels 6 hours north from Folsom, just outside of Sacramento, to Arcata, CA for the Humboldt State Running Camp. There, we live in the university dorms for one week and eat, sleep and breathe running. We arrive friends but leave family. 

At the end of the week, it is tradition for the boys' and girls' teams to gather in conference rooms to discuss goals for the season. This is a team-led affair -- the goals we set are our own, and we agree as a group to take responsibility for them. Many of our ambitions are tangible and concrete, and easy to be held accountable for: win a league or a section title, attain a certain team 5k average. However, many are more abstract and require a level of personal discipline on the part of each team member: sleep 8 hours every night, cut out sugary foods, do morning doubles. The process we follow is not rocket science and it is no big secret. As our Coach Robert Grove says, "Success leaves clues."

After last years' berth at the state meet culminated in the team placing 2nd, we knew this year that a team title was attainable especially since we returned __ of our top 7. (Discuss some of the top 7 here, introductions and say what makes each of them special)

Our season began with ___ (talk about the first race and how it went)

Despite some early season victories, our season was not without challenges. (Discuss some difficulties you faced, how you overcame them. Maybe races you lost, injuries some of you faced, etc.)

(Not sure what you want to talk about from here. It would be good if you discussed why the team is special to you, how it has changed your life and helped you develop as a person, etc. Talk about the growth you've seen in your teammates too).
